## Meeting 7
#### 10/31/18 4:30PM-6:00PM

During this meeting, we realized we were basically all sick with something. Nevertheless, we met in person in the engineering center. We focused on how to build out the front end using dummy api data, along with ensuring that the front end would be kept up to date. We discussed having some of the back-end engineers assist development on the front-end due to them knowing the APIs better.
