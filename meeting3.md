## Meeting 3
#### 10/10/18 8:30pm - 10:00pm

We began work on the lengthy Milestone 2, where our main challenge was constructing a three week sprint. Most of this meeting consisted of writing our descriptions in our pdf of what the milestone was requiring, and we began all trying to get the template project to run on our own computers. The homework for this meeting was to make sure that everyone had everything running by our next meeting on Sunday so we could start to look at how the project is set up.
