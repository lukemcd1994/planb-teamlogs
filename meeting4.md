## Meeting 4
#### 10/14/18 6:00pm - 7:30pm

During this meeting, we concluded our work on milestone 2. Most of our work this week consisted of populating our project mnanager Trello with tasks for everyone to do. This meant determining our first three week sprint, which is we set the goals fairly high for, but it consists of mostly everything except the full UI. In addition, we came to a unanimus decision to each commit to our own unique branch in our project repo.
